## Tools

Useful tools for Masters and PhD students that wants to spend their time doing research instead of mundane problems such as bibliography, crashing programs and lost data one week before the delivery(!),

### LaTeX

Microsoft Word and its open-source siblings (WYSIWYG text processors) are good for 2 things:

  - Shopping lists (but not too long, just the groceries for 1 week)
  - Recommendation letters

Please do NOT use Microsoft Word for writing your dissertation. Makes my work hard because I need to install it, track changes, email numerous documents that drain my hard drive quota, etc.

I have heard great things about Office 365, but it still does not solve the bibliography management problems as far as I know, and keeps me, and my works, chained to a specific vendor.

Another thing I do not like about Word for research documents is that research writing is a creative process, and Word is simply not designed for creative writing. When you want to just write your thoughts as they flow, the last thing you need is 30 different buttons to remind you that you need to use styles, format with bold, italic, click click click to add a reference here and there... Just you and your text, that is all you need. And LaTeX produces beautiful documents according to actual typographic and editing standards made by people who know much more about it than me! Why fight with your editor to get something beautiful out of it? And page breaks? Give ME a break!!

#### Why LaTeX is better for scientific writing

  - Function over form
  - Absolute focus on content in detriment of formatting problems to distract you every 30 seconds
  - You can use your own text editor! Nothing like just your thoughts, your coffee mug, a fully black window and a blinking cursor.
  - Produces the most beautiful documents on this side of the universe...perhaps when I see alien documentation will change my mind
  - All plain text-based, meaning that your text is safe and not locked inside a huge binary file that can become corrupted at any second after a bad crash/recovery
  - Did I mention it is plain text-based? This means versioned documents using Git/SVN(for those stuck in the early 2000s)/Hg, etc.
  - Separation between images and text keeps assets much more manageable instead of being embedded in a huge binary. Want to reuse that great diagram in another? Say no to "Export Image as..."
  - Easy to reuse text across documents because the structure is the same, either for a short paper or a huge document with fancy structure and formatting. This is good if you want to completely change the layout of your document to try different layouts for your dissertation, with the same actual contents. Think like HTML and CSS. You take your HTML with you, and the LaTeX template is like a different CSS. Also, remember that you should not plagiarise, not even yourself! Cite accordingly.
  - Huge [number of packages](https://ctan.org) for adding fancy links, formatting, [code highlight blocks](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings), managing [acronyms](https://ctan.org/pkg/acronym) and [glossaries](https://ctan.org/pkg/glossary) appropriately (hey, did I expand the acronym the first time? hmmm need to Ctrl+F my Word document)...
  - Open-source (ok, you probably don't care about this, and frankly neither do I---it is just an added bonus)

Anyway, after this provocative text I hope the advantages of LaTeX are quite clear.
