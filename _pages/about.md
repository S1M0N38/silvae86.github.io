## About me

Curently a Full Stack Senior Software Engineer at [Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com).

### Past adventures

Previously I was a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at [Kuhne+Naegel](https://pt.kuehne-nagel.com), working on software that streamlines customs-related procedures.

Before that, I was a Full Stack Engineer at [GYANT](https://gyant.com). The company builds advanced solutions supported by Artificial Intelligence to help patients find the assistance they need.

GYANT's AI virtual assistant reduces clinical strain and support staff overhead, improves outcomes, and exceeds patient expectations.

I hold a PhD in Informatics Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, where I also used to lecture (2016-2020). I specialised on research data management, working on FEUP's InfoLab building Dendro, a solution to help researchers describe and share their datasets in a clear and reusable way.

I have experience in many programming languages Javascript-NodeJS (7+ years), AngularJS, PHP with MVC frameworks, etc.) On the mobile side, I am an experienced freelancer iOS Developer with several Apps published on the App Store.

On the DevOps side, I have experience with testing and automated deployment pipelines using Vagrant, Docker, Jenkins and Bash scripting overall. Continuous integration tools such as Git and GitHub, Travis, Coveralls, Codacy and etc. are a daily part of my work.

Previously I also worked at Deloitte and Sysnovare, in which I worked on SAP modules, business blueprinting and software processes restructuring.

I am also a self-taught mechanic on my spare time... and I love Toyota classic cars!

##  Classic Car Mechanics

*Me driving my old 1987 Corolla.*{:class="img-caption"}

I used to have a 1987 Toyota Corolla AE86, also known as Hachi-Roku or literally "eight-six" in Japanese. The car was stolen some years ago, so no more of that. Now I drive a 2003 Diesel Corolla Station Wagon---not exciting but nice to drive.

I have a YouTube channel covering car mechanics and repairs. I called it Toyota Mechanics Video Guides, and you can check it out on YouTube: [Click me](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbjjlEagh5_nduX_u-SkvdQ).
