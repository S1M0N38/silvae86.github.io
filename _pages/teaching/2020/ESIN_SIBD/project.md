##  Objective

The development of a small dynamic website using the technologies studied during the course.

The assignment should be done in groups of 2 elements. The constitution of these groups should be proposed by the students themselves but approved by the teacher to ensure they are balanced.

The theme of the website should also be proposed by the students and approved by the teacher.

No frameworks or external libraries are allowed (jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, etc...). You must write everything from scratch.


## Delivery

The only delivery will be the website itself:

- SQL script to create the database.
- All PHP, CSS, images and other files in a zipped file.
- A README.txt file in the root folder containing data about the authors and how to install the project at the FEUP web server [gnomo.fe.up.pt](http://gnomo.fe.up.pt).

**Delivery date**: Before the last practical class of the semester. 

**Presentation**: In the last practical class of the semester. 

**Format of presentation**: The presentation will be carried out by the students and to the teachers of the practical classes. No slides are required, and only the working website should be presented.

### Final checklist

- Did you run your whole script on a blank database in the Server? does it run without errors? 
- Did you validate your HTML and CSS? 
- Do all your web pages render correctly in the browser, without 404 errors (use the browser inspector for this)

## Words of advice 

Here is some advice for a successful and fun experience during the course.

### Do the database right, before moving to code

Without the proper foundation (a correct database schema) any code you write on top will not work properly. Finish and validate your database schema with your practical class professor before starting to code.

### Planning ahead

It is a good idea to work *smart* instead of *hard*. Split your problem into smaller ones, prioritize those, and add more features as time allows. Basic functionality like a list in a homepage or the login should **not** fail on the day of the demo, especially if you spent time implementing other "optional" features.

In the professional world, all client requirements are broken down into smaller features that must be prioritized, their effort estimated, and some even need to be dropped. What seems very interesting / essential today may not seem like a good idea two weeks from now, and may be dropped algether. 

### Keep it simple

Make the CSS simpler but cleaner (write less code and validate it as you go). If the website has so many issues that I cannot navigate it easily or even find all the features you implemented... your grade will suffer. Simple and working is always better than complex and buggy.

### Avoid caffeine

Please do not wait until the last week to work seriously on the project. Coding (especially CSS) is not something you want to in all-nighter.

### Unequal sharing of work

If something is not going well in a project group, I need to know as soon as possible, and I trust you to tell me of any anomalies. I will not enquire about this, and in the absence of any complaints, I will assume everything is OK with the work group.

I will **not** accept complaints about this after the grades are published.

### Last-minute emails

Do not wait until the last weekend before the delivery of the work to start emailing me questions about it. I have a personal life too and you may not get an answer in time.
