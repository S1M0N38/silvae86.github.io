## Answers to students' emails concerning the topic selection

### Email 1

> Good night!
>
> We have some questions regarding the project, namely regarding its objective. Are we supposed to build a web application that interacts with the user? Is the purpose of consulting the website to acquire some data?
> We have already been doing some research related to our area. What we found were some examples of Bioinformatics sites, in which the objective is to acquire data related to a certain area. We also found some type of platforms for accessing patient data, in which they can, for example: make an appointment online, consult medical prescriptions, etc. But we don't know which one will be the most suitable, or if it fulfils the project's objectives.
> Would it also be possible to give us some more examples of projects?

> The application to be developed will be a dynamic website (with editing, visualization, listings, login and logout functions, etc.) with a pleasant interface (responsibility of the CSS sheets) and which saves the data in a sqlite3 relational database.

> It seems to me very interesting your idea of ​​trying to implement something related to your technical knowledge in the fields of medicine, as you can capitalize on both areas. In fact, all students are invited to try to implement something that they "bring from home", something that is close to them, instead of the normal "football club", "recipe site", "restaurant" etc. If you choose to implement one of the latter, I recommend that you give it a "twist", or in other words, something special. 
> For example, if it is a football club, it may have a feature that allows you to buy and sell players, manage partnerships and promotions in those partners, instead of just registering lists of players and numbers of goals scored (just one example). This is up to you ... the interesting thing is to be original, and use EVERYTHING that I teach you in practical and theoretical classes.

> One of the most important challenges in the project is, however, to organize and manage your time properly. In such a project it is very easy to get lost in the detailing of endless requirements and in the implementation of complex things. As in a professional environment, you need to decide where you are going to invest most of your effort. For example, if you decide to implement a medical appointment scheduling feature, you will have to implement scheduling logic, to prevent the same time slot from being allocated to two different appointments. If you ignore this functionality and focus on buying (from suppliers) and selling (to patients) medicines, they will have to manage suppliers, prices...
> 
> So, whatever the topic (management of a pharmacy, clinic, clinical analysis center, etc.), the greatest challenge is choosing what to implement---which features are you going to focus your effort. 
> 
> Finally, and answering your question directly, it is possible to make a quality project with this idea of ​​clinical management platforms.

> I hope I have clarified your doubts!
