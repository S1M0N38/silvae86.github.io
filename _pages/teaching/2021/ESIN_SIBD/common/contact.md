## Questions answering schedule

Institutional e-mail: [jrsilva@fe.up.pt](mailto:jrsilva@fe.up.pt)

If you have any questions or doubts, you can find me on **Fridays from 5pm to 6pm via [Zoom](https://zoom.us)**, using a Room URL + Room Password that you can find on [Moodle](https://moodle.up.pt), after authenticating and accessing the page of the course unit.

- If you have questions regarding an exercise or project-related issue, please **contact the professor of your practical class**, as they will have most knowledge regarding your work.
- Student/Worker students are encouraged to show up at this schedule and present the progress of their work and the practice exercises that they should do at home.
