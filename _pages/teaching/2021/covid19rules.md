# COVID-19 guidelines 

As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic will affect the classes for the school year of 2020/2021. 

To comply with the regulations specified by the University of Porto and the Direction of FEUP, I have prepared a few rules that students and professors should follow to ensure the well-being and academic success of everyone involved.

**Please read these guidelines carefully and [email me](mailto:jrsilva@fe.up.pt) if you still have any questions. I will answer here for everyone to see.**



## General Rules



- All persons are required to wear appropriate masks whenever they are inside FEUP premises.

- Desinfection materials will be provided for students to clean their keyboard and mouse when using a FEUP computer in class.
- Besides the personal protection materials offered at FEUP, students should feel free to bring their own desinfectants if they want.

## Classes: Remote or in person?



The FEUP Direction has specified the following rules:



In Portuguese:

> As atividades letivas irão assim decorrer em ambiente misto, com aulas a distância (tipo A) e aulas presenciais (tipo B), modos já previstos na elaboração dos horários:
>
>  
>
> ·     Aulas do tipo A (em geral, as teóricas) vão funcionar integralmente a distância, devendo ser em modo síncrono a partir da FEUP. 
>
> ·     Aulas do tipo B (em geral, as práticas), presenciais. Nestes casos, as aulas podem ocorrer com toda a turma presente, se a sala atribuída permitir um distanciamento entre estudantes adequado, ou podem ter de ser separadas em dois grupos que terão aulas presenciais em semanas alternadas.



In English:




> Teaching activities will thus take place in a mixed environment, with distance classes (type A) and face-to-face classes (type B), as already provided for in the preparation of timetables:
>
> 
>
> ·      Type A classes (in general, theoretical) will work completely remotely, and should be in synchronous mode from FEUP.
>
> 
>
> ·      Type B classes (in general, the practical ones), face-to-face. In these cases, classes can take place with the entire class present, if the assigned room allows for adequate distance between students, or they may have to be separated into two groups that will have face-to-face classes on alternate weeks.



### Theoretical classes 

To comply with these orders, we will have theoretical classes exclusively via remote connection on Zoom (see the [moodle](https://moodle.up.pt) course page for the Room link and Password).



### Practical classes



We will start the practical classes in the alternate attendance mode. This means that, every week, only half of each class will will be present in classroom. 

Check at the course plan page to see which classes you need to attend in person.

Even though only half will attend in person, the remaining students at that class will be able to attend remotely, via Zoom. Rooms will be set up for the practical class and the professors will do their best to share the contents, so that everyone can follow:

- Transmitting what is written on the board or drawing on the computer screen, whenever necessary
- Live coding by sharing their screen

All students, including the ones physically present in class, should join the Zoom classroom for that particular class. This will be necessary for asking questions, as explained below.



#### Asking and answering doubts and questions in class



During the practical classes, students ask questions that require the professor to come close to the student to answer the question. In order to reduce the risk of virus transmission, we will implement the following measures:

- When there is a question involving theoretical exercises, involving drawing, the question scenario will be replicated on the board or in the computer screen by the professor and solved there.

- When there is a question involving code present the student's computer, that student will be asked to present their screen using Zoom's "Share Screen" feature. The professors will then request control of the student's computer to solve the issue from their seat, without having to come close to the student. 

  - Students are advised to turn off all messaging apps and other non-work related applications during class, as their screen will be shared with the entire class while the doubt is being cleared. 

  - Suggestion: If you use your personal computer in class, create a separate user account that you only use during practical classes. This way, you will have a clean Desktop and Documents folder, and no personal information can be shared by accident when you share your screen. At the end of the semester, you can delete that account and keep your computer clean.

    

## Contact and doubts clearing

Institutional e-mail: [jrsilva@fe.up.pt](mailto:jrsilva@fe.up.pt)

If you have any questions or doubts, you can find me on **Fridays from 5pm to 6pm via [Zoom](https://zoom.us)**, using a Room URL + Room Password that you can find on [Moodle](https://moodle.up.pt), after authenticating and accessing the page of the course unit.

Student/Worker students are encouraged to visit and present the progress of their work and the practice exercises that they should do at home.
