name: purpose
## Purpose

- To represent the data model of an information system

- Programmers and system designers alike can understand

- Often derived from the reality of a system as described by the client (usually in text)

- Can later be converted into a relational schema

.footnote[These slides will use the example of a furniture manufacturing company to illustrate the syntax of UML class diagrams.]

---
name: classes
## Classes

Classes are used to represent the main entities of the system. 

Their syntax consists of a box with two main sections.

- The first section contains the **name** of the class 
- The bottom will contain all the Class's [Attributes](#attributes), **one per line**.

.center[.imglg[![Attributes](../diagrams/UMLDiagrams/Classes.png)]]

.footnote[Class names are always represented in the singular, as a class denotes a **type** of entity, instead of a **set** of all entities of a certain type.]

---
name: Attributes
## Attributes

- Attributes represent characteristics of all objects of the Class. They have basic types like `integer`, `double`, `string`, etc.

- Attributes cannot be multi-valued; if you have an attribute that can have multiple values for an object of a class, that attribute is likely a Class and should be promoted to that.

---
name: generalization
## Generalization

- Used to extract the common characteristics of a set of classes. A **superclass** is extracted, containing the common attributes of all **subclasses**.

- It is represented by an equilateral triangle pointing to the superclass and attached to it, with lines coming from it towards all subclasses.

.foonote[`Employee`s and `Customer`s are both `Person`s, so they have the attributes of a `Person`, as well as their own particular attributes]

---
name: associations
## Associations

- Associations are binary relationships between classes

- Represented by a line drawn between the two classses that we want to associate

.center[.imglg[![Association](../diagrams/UMLDiagrams/Association.png)]]

At each end of the line we add the [multiplicity](#multiplicity) of the association.
