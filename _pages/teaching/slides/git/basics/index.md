## About

- A **distributed** source code **version control** system.

- **Version control** because it tracks all changes made to the code of a software solution

- **Distributed**, because it does not require a **repository server**
	- All collaborators of the repository can synchronize their code without the need for a "central authority"
- <u>Keeps your code safe, </u>

.footnote[.red[*]We will cover some basics of Git usage in these slides. More advanced usage can be explored in the bibliography]

## Concepts

- A **repository** is a folder with some files added by the VCS. 
	- In `Git`, the root of the folder will contain an *invisible* `.git`.red[*] folder with information that it uses to keep track of the changes made to everything in that folder, among other things.
- **Cloning** is to create a local copy of a repository present at some remote location
- **Changes** are calculated automatically by Git whenever a file inside a repository is edited. They refer to lines added, removed or modified in all the files in the repository, as well as files added, deleted or renamed.
- **Commits** are similar to milestones on a road: they are used to "mark" the current state of the repository as a milestone. When you commit your changes you are only modifying the local copy of the repository. Nothing will be sent 
- **Pulling** means to retrieve the latest changes present in the remote
- **Pushing** is to send all your local commits i.e. to send all changes made locally back to the remote
- **Branches** are like the branches on a tree. You can branch out your code to work separately on a certain functionality. When you think it is stable, you can **merge** it back into the main branch, which is like the trunk of a tree
- **Merging** is to merge all the changes made in a separate branch back into the main branch of the repository.
