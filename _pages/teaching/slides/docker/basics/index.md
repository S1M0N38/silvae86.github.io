# Docker
[a container runtime for software deployments]

## Introduction and Basics
by [Jo√£o Rocha da Silva](https://silvae86.github.io), based on ['Using Docker: Developing and Deploying Software with Containers'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/using-docker/9781491915752/) by *Adrian Mouat* and [other sources](#references).

name: why
## Why Docker? (1/2)

### Main advantages

- **Flexibility**
	- Practically any application can be containerized
- **Lightweight**
	- Containers share the host Kernel, without virtualizing an OS for every application, saving resources
- **Portability**
	- Ensures portability of execution environment on any machine
	- Application, pre-requisites and dependencies are packaged together
- **Scalability**
	- From a single container on your laptop or thousands in the cloud, it is all the same technology
- **Loose coupling**
	- Containers are highly self-sufficient and encapsulated, and can be updated individually without upsetting others
- **Security**: Containers apply aggressive constraints and isolations to processes without any configuration required on the part of the user.

## Why Docker? (2/2)

### More advantages

**Elasticity for the cloud**

- In the cloud, computational resources should be purchased as needed
	- Too many users for too little computational power &rarr; poor system performance
	- Too many resources for too little users &rarr; waste of money
- Docker makes it easier to scale applications up to meet peak loads, and then scale down during downtime
	- Spin up more or less containers (*replicas* of the application) across a datacenter, to respond to application loading

- **Separation of code from state**:
	- Separates code+infrastructure (*application logic*) configuration from Data (*application state*)
	- Backups only need to worry about the data, as code and infrastructure can be built on-the-fly

- **Native CPU scheduling**
 	- On Linux, containers are seen by the Kernel as independent processes, so they can be efficiently managed by the CPU scheduler

name: virtual-machines
## Virtual Machines

- A virtual machine is a software that *simulates* a computer's hardware and software components
- Several **virtual** machines can run in a single **physical**, or *bare metal* machine
	- Virtual machines are typically called "guests" while the physical machines where they run are called "hosts"
	- Makes it easy to set up a *multi-tenant* environment, where resources are shared among the various VMs, which can even belong to
- The *hypervisor* is the software that powers the virtual machines
	- It provides virtual networking and storage layers (virtual network cards and virtual hard drives)
	- Controls access to CPU and memory of the physical machine

## VM vs. Bare Metal

Advantages and disadvantages of running virtual machines over 'bare metal'

.left[
### Advantages
- Portability and hardware-agnosticism
	- The same VM can run in computers with very different hardware and software configurations
	- The *hypervisor* provides an abstraction layer between the virtual and physical hardware configurations
- Faster disaster recovery
	- Virtual machines can be backed up
- Isolation
	- Improved security for shared hardware machines-several users can have full administration privileges their own VMs, but without
- Abstraction

### Disadvantages
- High resource consumption
	 - The physical machine needs to virtualize everything, including the operating system
- Lack of access to some low-level functions
	- Everything is virtualized,

- Containers does not need to virtualize the Operating System
- Containers share the host's operating system and *kernel*
