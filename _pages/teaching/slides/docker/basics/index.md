# Docker
[container runtime for portable and scalable application deployment]

## Introduction and Basics
by [Jo√£o Rocha da Silva](https://silvae86.github.io), based on ['Using Docker: Developing and Deploying Software with Containers'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/using-docker/9781491915752/) by *Adrian Mouat* and [other sources](#references).

name: why
## Why Docker?

- Separates Code + Infrastructure from Data (*state*)
- Ensures portability of execution environment (no more "works on my machine!")
- Makes it easi*er* to scale solutions dynamically by running more or less containers
	- Solution can handle more or less users as needed
	- Important for the cloud, where resources (and the costs!) are dynamic

name: virtual-machines
## Virtual Machines

- A virtual machine is a software that *simulates* a computer's hardware and software components
- Several virtual machines can run in a single physical, or *bare metal* machine
	- Makes it easy to set up a *multi-tenant* environment, where resources are shared among the various VMs, which can even belong to
- The *hypervisor* is the software that powers the virtual machines
	- It provides virtual networking and storage layers (virtual network cards and virtual hard drives)
	- Controls access to CPU and memory of the physical machine
- Virtual machines

## VM vs. Bare Metal

Advantages and disadvantages of running virtual machines over 'bare metal'

.left[
### Advantages
- Portability and hardware-agnosticism
	- The same VM can run in computers with very different hardware and software configurations
	- The *hypervisor* provides an abstraction layer between the virtual and physical hardware configurations
- Faster disaster recovery
	- Virtual machines can be backed up
- Isolation
	- Improved security for shared servers, as several users can have full administration previledges their own VMs
- Abstraction
	-

### Disadvantages
- High resource consumption
	 - The physical machine needs to virtualize everything, including the operating system
- Lack of access to some low-level functions
	- Everything is virtualized,

- Containers does not need to virtualize the Operating System
- Containers share the host's operating system and *kernel*

## VMs vs Containers (Cont'd)

Advantages and disadvantages of running containers when compared to virtual machines

.left[
### Advantages
- Vast reduction in resource usage
- Much faster spin up and spin down than a VM
