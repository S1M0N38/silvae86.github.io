I have supervised several MSc dissertations at FEUP, both in Information Science and Informatics Engineering. Based on these, I have compiled several guidelines for new MSc students who want to write a good dissertation.

## Tips for a good MSc dissertation

For some tips about how to carry out a successful MSc dissertation, I have compiled a list of strongly opinionated articles (read at your own peril!).

### Choosing your supervisor

This is very personal, and is closely linked to the topic that you wish to follow. My only advice is to get in touch with your potential supervisors beforehand and try to get a feel for their research interests; try to see if they align with what you want to learn before the end of your course.

Get in touch with everyone, do not wait until the last moment.

### Choosing a document template

Ask your supervisor if there is an established document template for the dissertation. In the case of FEUP's Masters in Informatics Engineering, the template is available at [Prof. Jo√£o Correia Lopes' website](https://web.fe.up.pt/~jlopes/doku.php/teach/feupteses).
