I have supervised several MSc dissertations at FEUP, both in Information Science and Informatics Engineering. Based on these, I have compiled several guidelines for new MSc students who want to write a good dissertation.

## Tips for a good MSc dissertation

For some tips about how to carry out a successful MSc dissertation, I have compiled a list of strongly opinionated articles (read at your own peril!).

### Choosing your topic

My advice is to look at the Curricular Units that you have enjoyed the most, and get in touch with the professors that lectured you in those units. If you can find common ground for collaboration in a research context, go for it!

Also, please do not hurry to go into the industry. The final dissertation is a great opportunity for you to have a taste of a research environment and practices. It is a great way for you to do something you really like before you leave the academic environment and start your professional career. Industry is really cool too, don't get me wrong---but it is harder to do exploratory research work like you can in an academic environment. Also, you can often get a research scholarship with your Masters dissertation if it can contribute to a research project; talk with your potential supervisor to see what are the chances of that.

### Your supervisor

This is very personal, and is closely linked to the topic that you wish to follow. My only advice is to get in touch with your potential supervisors beforehand and try to get a feel for their research interests; try to see if they align with what you want to learn before the end of your course. Does this person have a good track record of supervisions? What is the opinion of the older students that were supervised by your potential supervisors? Be proactive and get in touch with everyone, do not wait until the last moment.

### Document template

Ask your supervisor if there is an established document template for the dissertation. In the case of FEUP's Masters in Informatics Engineering, the template is available at [Prof. Jo√£o Correia Lopes' website](https://web.fe.up.pt/~jlopes/doku.php/teach/feupteses).

### State of the art

Anyone reading your state of the art should not soccumb to "death by citation", or be "citation-machine-gunned" to death. This means that a good state of the art should not limit itself to referring the main contribution of a long list of papers.

Just citing a single sentence from a bunch of papers is worth very little. Insteady, try to relate what the authors say and comparing their approaches and conclusions. What do they have in common? What distinguishes them from each other?

When preparing your dissertation,
