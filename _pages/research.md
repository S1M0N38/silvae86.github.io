## Research

My main research interests are semantic web technologies and their practical applications
to research data management, combining Information Science, Computer Science knowledge and solid engineering.

I am particularly interested in graph database applications, database modelling, information
system architectures, software quality and software testing. I apply my research to the design and construction of
the research data repositories of the future.
