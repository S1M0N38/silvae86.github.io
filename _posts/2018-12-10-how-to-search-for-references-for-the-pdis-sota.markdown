## How to search for good references

For those who are doing the state of art in PDIS, I advise you to use the [http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/?search=Software+Engineering&by=all&source=CORE2018&sort=arank&page=1](CORE2018 Ranking) to find the best conferences in your area (order by ranking, the best are A *, then A, B, etc.). After seeing the best, look at the [ACM digital library](https://dl.acm.org/) or [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) or just [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) if all else fails!

### Example

Nuno is interested in reading the latest publications related to Automatic Builds for his thesis. Go to CORE2018 and search for Software Engineering. Since he is a smart and busy engineering student, he wants to read the best ones first. 

#### The CORE2018 Conference Ranking

He searches CORE2018 for Software Engineering, and then sorts by Ranking to see the A * conferences of Software Engineering at CORE2018:

#### IEEE Xplore

The best conferences are usually either IEEE or ACM, so it goes to IEEE Xplore and looks for the title and acronym of the conference "(International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)" in this case.) Copy-Paste in the IEEE Xplore search box gives this :

[click here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=2018%20IEEE%2FACM%2040th%20International%20Conference%20on%20Software%20Engineering)

In the case of IEEE Xplore, all papers should appear, but below the title appears the conference where the article was published.

He clicks on the link with the name of the conference and will give the list of all conference papers:

#### ACM Digital Library

If you do not find it in IEEE Xplore, it does the same but in the ACM Digital Library. In this case, since ICSE is very good, also find it there:

[click here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3183428&picked=prox)

He clicks on the "Table of Contents" and has access to the list of papers:

![Acm Dl Toc](/assets/images/post-images/2018-12-10-how-to-search-for-references-for-the-pdis-sota/acm_dl_toc.png)

Because he wants to download the articles, he does his research inside the FEUP network, otherwise there are no PDFs for anyone.


### And where do I publish?

Of course every Masters student should try to publish a research paper to get an excellent grade. But where?

After knowing which are the best conferences in your area, look for them at [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/allcat).

The search function is somewhat hidden, so here it is:

Good research!
