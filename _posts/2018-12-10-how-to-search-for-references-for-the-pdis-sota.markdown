## How to search for good references

For those who are doing the state of art in PDIS, I advise you to use the [CORE2018 Ranking](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/?search=Software+Engineering&by=all&source=CORE2018&sort=arank&page=1) to find the best conferences in your area (order by ranking, the best are A *, then A, B, etc.). Afterwards, look at the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/) or [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) or just [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) if all else fails!

We will follow a future Informatics Engineer, who wants to do good research for the state of the art of the dissertation.

*(S)He is interested in reading the latest publications related to continuous integration, a topic within **Software Engineering**. Being a smart but very busy engineering student, (s)he wants to read the best ones first...*

### The CORE2018 Conference Ranking

A good first step is to go to the [CORE2018 conference ranking](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) and search for "Software Engineering". Then, sort the results by Ranking to see the A* conferences of Software Engineering at CORE2018. The best ones are A*, followed by A, then B, etc.

Here is [the result](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/?search=Software+Engineering&by=all&source=CORE2018&sort=arank&page=1).


### IEEE Xplore

The best conferences are usually either IEEE or ACM, so it goes to IEEE Xplore and looks for the title and acronym of the conference "(International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)" in this case.) Copy-Paste in the IEEE Xplore and....

Here is [the result](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=2018%20IEEE%2FACM%2040th%20International%20Conference%20on%20Software%20Engineering).

In the case of IEEE Xplore, all papers should appear, but below the title appears the conference where the article was published.

![Ieee Xplore Conference Link](/assets/images/post-images/2018-12-10-how-to-search-for-references-for-the-pdis-sota/ieee_xplore_conference_link.png)

By clicking on the link with the name of the conference, it is possible to get the compete [list of its papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8452039).

### ACM Digital Library

If one cannot find anything in IEEE Xplore, the next option is the ACM Digital Library. In this case, since [http://www.icse-conferences.org/](ICSE) is a top conference, it will also be [there](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3183428&picked=prox).

Clicking on the "Table of Contents" gives one access to the list of papers:

![Acm Dl Toc](/assets/images/post-images/2018-12-10-how-to-search-for-references-for-the-pdis-sota/acm_dl_toc.png){:class="img-center"}

Because one sometimes needs to download the papers in PDF format, one should do this research inside the FEUP network, otherwise... no PDFs for anyone.

### Google Scholar

Well, this needs no explanation.

## And where do I publish my own paper?

{% include info.html content="It is a good idea to make a list of the relevant conferences in your area and their submission deadlines, so that you can plan your work and target a conference submission." %}

Of course every Masters student should try to publish a research paper to get an excellent grade. But where?

After knowing which are the best conferences in the dissertation topic, a student can look for the upcoming Calls For Papers, for example at [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/allcat) (they will be shown by categories).

The search function is somewhat hidden, so here it is:
![Wikicfp Search](/assets/images/post-images/2018-12-10-how-to-search-for-references-for-the-pdis-sota/wikicfp_search.png){:class="img-center"}

<!-- {% include danger.html content="It is advised to make a list of the relevant conferences in your area and their submission deadlines, so that you can organize your work properly" %} -->

<!-- {% include warning.html content="It is advised to make a list of the relevant conferences in your area and their submission deadlines, so that you can organize your work properly" %} -->

Good research!
