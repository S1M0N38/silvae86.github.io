Interviews are the single best opportunity for a developer to gauge the job/company/team that they are getting themselves into. Being a developer myself, I decided to write this post with some questions and lessons learned from going through several interview processes. I have also interviewed many developers throughout my professional career, so maybe I can distill some valid information for those of you looking for a job.

Success in professional life is a careful blend of technical skill, building a solid contact network and making the right decisions. Each of these three pillars influences the others.

## Managing expectations

Whether you are stuck patching up legacy code, in charge of reverse-engineering black-box systems on life support just to keep them running, or feel pressure to jump into some modern tech to keep honing your skills, this is motivation for change.

You just got that LinkedIn message that promises to double your current salary! Now you have opportunity coming your way.

Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
--Seneca (Philosopher of Ancient Greece)

Getting a message for a job that is __just perfect__ for you does not mean that you have to let the recruiter do all the talking. In fact, you should see the interview as a test to the company's policies, environment, tech stack, and development processes.

It is key to manage your expectations during a recruitment process. No matter how exciting the first proposal may look like, you should assume that there will be always adjustments until the final proposal that will land on your table to sign, when you reach the end of the recruitment process.

Another great way to keep a cool head is to never be in a single recruitment process. Keep several alternatives open so that you can not only know what other companies in the market are offering, but also negotiate every each salary requirement with less pressure on your shoulders. This way, if a particular recruitment process fails, there will be less of a psychological impact.

## In first interview

The first interview of an IT recruitment process usually involves a psychological and English language assessment. Recruiters often ask if you know certain technologies, but no one will go into details about how to implement certain algorithms or how to design an entire system. The person performing the interview is often not from an Engineering background.


## The second/third/fourth/... technical interviews

First, more than 2 technical interviews for a company that is not Google, Amazon or Facebook is not worth it, search elsewhere. If the company did not understand if you are a match or not after 2 interviews, then in my opinion they do not know what they are looking for, or think other people's time is not important.

Often these are carried out by senior engineers that take time out of their usually hectic work schedule to help out the company in finding new hires. This means that:

- They are generous and like to give back to the company, as interviewers usually alternate and sometimes volunteer to carry out these tasks within the team.
- They like to meet new people and see how they work, which technologies they are familiar with, and their life experience.

Also: 

- Interviewers can be thinking about the urgent tasks that absolutely positively must go into production in the next sprint, but still take the time to do your interview.
	- **Thank them for it**, and for listening to your frustrations when your code does not compile due to a line break when the online coding editor does not warn you about it like your own IDE does! ** __(That is from personal experience btw)__.
- Your interviewer is an engineer like you! all they want is to allow a candidate's qualities to shine through. They also want to see if you are gonna be a tough person to work with or if you are nice and polite. 
- No one is there to grill you on purpose, and if they are, trust me... you do not want to work for that company in the first place!
- No engineer worth his/her salt likes to work with an a-hole! Interviews are an engineering team's first line of defense against those. 
	- Technical skills can be taught, frustration and resilience can be managed and trained... but politeness, respect, good manners and willingness to learn are the base of a nice working relationship. As an interviewer, I like to gauge these myself and then ask: "Would I like to work with this person?" If the answer is yes, I give positive feedback when asked !

## Questions

Here are some of the questions that I like to ask during a job interview. Some may seem trivial/naive at first, while others may seem like I am asking internal company details. 

If you are afraid to put off your interviewer, whenever you ask a question regarding tech stack / algorithms or processes, you can always start with "You don't have to answer this if you consider it to be internal company information"

- What are the problems that you face every day?

- What is the time that a build pipeline takes?

- What monitoring tools are in place?

- How do you typically debug a new issue filed by a client support member?

- What is the development process?

- Would you say that you are understaffed?

## Overall onboarding questions

### Is there a choice of hardware?

Unless the company you are applying to is tied to a particular tech stack that depends on Windows (typically all the .NET stuff) you should be offered a choice of hardware to work with (Mac, Windows, or Linux). While the choice of hardware is personal, the willingness of the company to let a developer choose their hardware is not. For me, personally, it indicates a forward thinking attitude by the company, who does not think small to the point of conditioning a developer's performance because of small cost savings. 

In short, if the company offers you underpowered/wrong hardware to work with, the management has their priorities wrong, and you should not join that company. They fail to understand that they are paying a developer a very high amount of money to then have him/her waste time waiting for compilations, learning to use an OS that is not their main, etc.

### Will you offer financial support for a home office setup?

## Contract terms-related questions

### Do you sponsor visas/relocation?

### Is there a signing bonus? 

### What is the notice period?

This is an often overlooked aspect because often developers will assume the default notice periods, as specified by their country's labour law. In Portugal, for example, it is common to have a 90-day experimental period where either party can break the contract without a justification and without any notice period. In special cases, like highly specialized positions, the law specifies an experimental period of 180 days. Software engineers typically fall under the second case.

In a superheated recruitment labour market like we are experiencing right now, where developers are in extremely high demand, a **longer** notice period benefits the company, since they have more time to hire replacement talent if an employee turns in their resignation papers. 

In a recession market, where the demand for developers may be lower, a **shorter** notice period will benefit the company, giving them the option of letting people go without paying them a salary during the longer notice period. 

> "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"

When you consider a new position, your goal should be to strike a balance between yourself and the company. Trying for a too short notice period may upset some companies, but that does not mean that you have to accept a 3 months notice period.

As a rule of thumb:

- Anything less than 30 days puts can put you in a tight spot financially, especially when you are a junior developer, have little knowledge in the technologies necessary for the job, or are going into a cutthroat consultancy business in hopes of rising quickly through the ranks. Some people may feel the pressure when they can be let go every week. This may also be a sign of a company that is looking for someone to do short term work and let them go, instead of being willing to invest in the employee's growth.
- 30 to 45 days is the sweet spot. It fits into most recruitment processes since the several interview stages typically span across this length of time. You will almost never put off any recruiters at the first interview.
- 2 months makes it harder but not impossible, but companies may be willing to wait a little more for you if you manage to land a more senior role. You might also be able to shorten it further using your days of holiday that may be withstanding, limiting the impact of the monetary compensation required to leave the company without serving the full 2 months. Beware, however: this should be your absolute upper limit for a notice period. 
- 3 months and more should be avoided this at all costs. It put off a lot of recruiters, since companies usually recruit for satisfying more immediate needs (projects starting in 1-3 months). It can put additional pressure on your finances, since it requires higher savings to pay for the compensation payment to the company you wish to leave. This can also force you into the worst situation of all: being forced to turn in your resignation letter after feeling so bad about your job that you want to leave at all costs. You resign and start serving your 90-day+ notice period; in the meanwhile, you will be desperately trying to get a job, and this pressure will show when you try to negotiate your new salary!


### Will I have paid holidays?

When applying for a full time job, the most common is 22 days of vacation per year. However, the company may be offering additional benefits such as:

- An additional day per working year, up to a maximum of 3
- 

## Negotiating salary


## Common fears?

We were all there before:

<quote>
- Interviewer: *So, is there anything else you want to know about the company?*
- You: *Hmm, no, I have no questions at this time, thank you!*
- Interviewer: *Alright, so I think we can wrap up for now. Thank you very much, and we will be in touch!*
</quote>

And like that, you just lost one of the best opportunities to know more about the company where you will be spending (at least) 8 hours a day for the foreseeable future. 

One can be nervous, feeling insecure, or just want the job so badly that we want to make a good impression at all costs! We feel that asking questions may: 

- Leave the interviewer them with the impression that we want to know too much about the company's internal processes; 
	- In Portugal we have a saying: *Perguntar não ofende* or in English, "Asking does not offend", which means that by asking you cannot make someone angry Start your question by saying: "If you cannot answer, thats okay, but I'd like to know..."
- Lead the conversation into a tough situation if the interviewer asks something we don't know anything about
