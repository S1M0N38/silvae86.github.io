## A little bit of history

I made my switch to the Mac around 2008, while I was still an MSc. student of Informatics Engineering. I wrote my Masters dissertation on a Early 2008 MacBook Pro, which started its life on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. These were the days of the iPod, Windows Vista had a terrible reputation, and a glowing Apple logo on the back of a computer lid was a rare sight in Portuguese university classrooms (at least outside of a Fine Arts class). 

Like many of its kind, my Macbook Pro died a painful death when its GPU, the flawed nVidia 8600GT finally gave up on me,  after it was my main work tool throughout an MSc dissertation, starting a YouTube channel, and the early stages of my Ph.D.

I still carry warm memories of using that computer. [Omnigraffle Pro 5](https://www.omnigroup.com/download) was awesome to design UML Class diagrams, which unlike [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/previous-versions/microsoft-visio-2007) on Windows or [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/) on Linux, had nice and smooth shadows, anti-aliased fonts and overall better look.

Overall, the typography on a Mac looked better. The keyboard was smooth, the monitor colorful and vibrant. The OS was truly **fun** to use (and Windows XP was actually a great OS). The subtle, pulsing glow of the default button in a modal window in Snow Leopard...I have to admit, I love the skeuomorphic design from those days. 

I had no idea how spoiled I was at that time. 

## Living the Mac OS X dream. Again.

Meet my 2010 MacBook Unibody White with an Intel 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo processor. I bought this laptop circa 2012, second hand, with a 1000-plus cycled battery, missing a couple of keys in the keyboard and an aftermarket power adapter lighter than some sugar packets. But hey, when you are a Ph.D. student you have to try to manage with the little money that you scrounge together. Then, I upgraded it as much as I could, with a new aftermarket battery (still lasts 4-5 hours in light use), a 250 GB Samsung 840 SSD, 8GB RAM (and the missing keyboard keys).

The thing about this laptop is that you can run many versions of Mac OS X, from Snow Leopard (10.6) up to Catalina (10.15) through the [unofficial patcher](https://github.com/dosdude1/macos-catalina-patcher) by dosdude1. 

## Using AFP mounts to compile this blog remotely

Because I like to use completely outdated/unsafe but absolutely beautiful operating systems to write my blog posts, I set out to find a way to use my MacBook as a text editing and music playing machine, so I can use the old TextMate 1.5 and Omnigraffle 5 Pro. At the same time, I can use a much more recent and more powerful computer to compile the sources of this blog.

It's easy to use a flash drive to transfer an entire project between machines and compile it in the more recent one. It is also easy to use Screen Sharing to work remotely on the more modern machine. Instead of using these methods, will use AFP shares to mount the folder in the vintage Mac on the modern machine. We then start the server that automatically compiles Then, whenever a file is saved on the folder of the vintage machine,
