Magsafe is (was? will be? I'm not sure...) a great technology, but the flimsy and non-user replaceable cables found in the Magsafe 1 and 2 chargers are always the main point of failure.

The new USB-C chargers have fixed this by making the cables removable, but those of us using an older MacBook with a torn charger cable still have to shell out 80â‚¬ for a brand new original or, even worse, go for a [cheap/fake eBay/Amazon counterpart](https://amzn.to/2NOL62s) for 1/4 of the cost.

Here is a complete guide to help you recover your old Macbook MagSafe charger by replacing only the torn cable with a new one.

# Parts

- Broken charger (obviously)
- A Magsafe 1 or Magsafe 2 replacement cable ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Maxons-Trade-Adapter-Connector-Magsafe2/dp/B012BV1XGA/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=magsafe+replacement+cable&qid=1614641790&sr=8-3))

# Whatever you do, do NOT buy a knockoff charger

Some may consider a knockoff charger instead of trying to repair their existing one. Please do **not** buy one of these. If you do not think you are able to undertake this repair, plese take it to a local repair shop and have them do it for you, or simply buy a genuine Apple charger.

Here are the main problems with knockoff chargers:

1. Their cables are flimsier than the original (as if that were possible...)
2. Manufacturers cut down on costs heavily, a.k.a. you really get what you pay for. Such chargers are much lighter, indicating the presence of less components, crude construction and no copper at all. In particular, the AC to DC conversion is performed using lower quality components, resulting in increased waste heat (inefficency) 
3. Buzzing and static in the 3.5mm headphone jack. I once had one of these chargers and its bad grounding caused my laptop's headphones to constantly buzz.
4. Voltage fluctuations can lead to unexpected shutdowns when the system is under load
5. The so-called __coil whine__, where you hear buzzing or hissing sounds coming from the charger
6. Lower or no protection against current peaks, which can zap your computer or 
6. Electric shocks! Yes, with my now deceased fake eBay charger I got a slight shock in my ears if I wore metal headphones, like my [Xiaomi Piston Headphones](https://amzn.to/3dSK6Fk).
