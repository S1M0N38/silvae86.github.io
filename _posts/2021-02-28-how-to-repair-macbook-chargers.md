Magsafe is (was? will again be?) a great technology, but the flimsy and non-user replaceable cables found in the Magsafe 1 and 2 chargers from Apple are always the main point of failure. The USB-C chargers have fixed this, with removable cables, but those of us with with an older MacBook with a torn charger cable still have to shell out 80â‚¬ for an original charger or, even worse, go for a cheap eBay counterpart
