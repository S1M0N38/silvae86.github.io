Key takeaways: 

<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
	<tr><td>Keep yourself updated, grow as an engineer to keep yourself in demand for years to come. </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Switching to a management role does not **need** to be your target. Developers are the last to be fired in a software house.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Stay professional and committed to your company, but aware of market opportunities</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Build a reputation every day and never burn bridges</td></tr>

Around 15 years ago, the work market was a barren wasteland of low-paid jobs in software development; the only way to get double digit raises every year was to join a consulting company (and forget you had a personal life by the way). Since Portugal's economy is tiny when compared to the US or other larger European countries, Portuguese developers had to be content with around a third or quarter of the salary of their foreign counterparts, while delivering similar value. 

Fortunately, gone are those days of stagnated low wages and being stuck working on legacy or company-specific technology that locked down a developer to a company for decades. The labor market is now full of awesome opportunities for developers. Whether you want a change in your career or simply a change of business area, or a raise above regular ones, there are a lot of companies offering valuable perks and the opportunities for learning the modern technology that will pay your bills for years to come. Just to name a few in different business areas, we have the shift to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure, the recent changes in React's programming structure (hooks in place of react-redux), or the increasing need for DevOps personnel to handle the many complexities of today's orchestrated and scalable software solutions.

## Remote work increased competition for talent... and salaries

Salaries have also been increasing by quite a lot, result of a worldwide competition by a lot of money that is out there searching for the best talent wherever it may be! In fact, the pandemic has exposed a simple fact that was already in the back of the mind of a lot of people, but only a handful of freelance developers and digital nomads were taking advantage of. Software developers do not __need__ to be stuck inside a cubicle nor to commute for hours, but they can be in the global labor market looking for the best developer salaries in the world. That being said, not everyone can live without an office nor physical contact with other colleagues. 

## Love the company, love yourself

{:.floatquote}
Love your job, but never fall in love with your company, because you never know when the company stops loving you.
--Narayana Murthy (Indian businessman)

What I read in this sentence is not that you should be aloof or disconnected from your company. Quite the opposite: it is in your best interest to tackle whatever cutting-edge efforts that your company is facing. Jump in that task force to investigate a new technology, take on that spike that pops up in the JIRA board... The payoff will be great for you and great for the company.

## Management roles 

For a long time, management roles were seen as the logic progression for a developer: the next step if you will. Technical profiles had to inevitably switch to a management role in the hopes of further salary and career advancement.
