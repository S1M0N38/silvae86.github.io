Here is a great recipe for cuttlefish, for those that like spicy food. With strong Portuguese roots, I added some oriental touches to give it an Asian twist, but without overdoing it.

## Ingredients

- 6 cuttlefish, cleaned of ink and skins (can use frozen in a pinch)
- 50g black olives, sliced
- 40g Bacon or chorizo
- 2 very ripe tomatoes
- 4 garlic cloves
- 4 table spoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3 pickled large chillies
- 1 large red chilli
- 1 teaspoon Bengali curry spices powder
- 2 bay leaves (louro in Portuguese)
- 1 large bunch of coriander
- 1/2 cup white wine (the same you drink, dont be cheap!)
- Salt and Pepper

## Preparation

1. Cut the cuttlefish into slices, wash them and drain them.

2. Bring a frying pan with the olive oil, add the crushed garlic, bay leaves and curry spices, and bring slowly to heat not to burn the spices. When the oil starts bubbling with the spice powder and the bay leaves are flat in the oil, add the cuttlefish and let it fry a little bit.

3. Then add the diced bacon/chorizo, as well as the peeled tomatoes and the 2 varieties of chillies cut into thin slices. Mix well.

4. When it begins to boil, season with salt and pepper and cook until the squids are tender. Before serving, carefully mix in the olives and coriander.

5. Serve with white basmati rice (cardamom optional, add to the rice water if you like the fragrance)

## Recommended wine

I enjoyed this with a 2017 Aveleda white, Alvarinho de Melgaço e Monção. Serve chilled, obviously.
