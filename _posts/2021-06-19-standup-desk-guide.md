*New standing desk*{:class="img-caption"}


Many of us Software Engineers spend too many hours sitting down. To add insult to injury, due to the pandemic I found myself working full remote without the chance to practice swimming, something that I love to do and keeps my back and shoulders healthy. It was clear to me that I had to do something about it. The first thing I thought about was replacing my fixed desk with an electric standing desk to reduce [Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) and help avoid pain..

Here I present a complete guide for choosing and setting up your own standing desk, which reduces the number of hours you spend sitting, in order to work remotely in a healthier way.

Standing desks are a worthwhile investment, especially if yours is able to move up and down several times during the day. As a bonus, on average you also burn around [200 calories more while standing than while sitting down](https://www.startstanding.org/calculate-calories-burned-sitting-vs-standing/). The main purpose of this build is a minimalistic but functional desk. This means less cables and no visible power adapters. I produced a video explaining my choice of components, assembly, review and final result. Check it out here:
