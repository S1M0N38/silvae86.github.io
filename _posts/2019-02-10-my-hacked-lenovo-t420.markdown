## About my pet project Lenovo T420

I have a Lenovo T420 that I love because of its unmatched 8-row keyboard. It is old and was slow with its original i5-2520m cpu... but it is very Linux friendly and runs MacOS too. A GitHub user called tluck has compiled [everything you need](https://github.com/tluck/Lenovo-T420-Clover) to get it running under MacOS (yes, even Catalina, an OS that no mac from 2011 supports...). Shame on you Apple ;-)

## Specs

I hacked up with the following goodies:

- Hacked BIOS to enable 1600Mhz DDR3 and Wifi Card Whitelist
- 2x 500GB Samsung Evo 860 SSDs in RAID 0 in caddy
- 1x 250GB mSata SSD Samsung Evo 860
- 9-cell battery for impressive 2:30hrs of battery life (lol)
- [AzureWave AW-CB160](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/BroadCom-AW-CB160-BCM94360HMB-WIFI-HALF-PCI-E-Wireless-BT-Card-BT4-0-WLAN-W003-/303426968043) 3-antenna 1300Mbps wifi card
- Intel 2960XM Extreme Edition (aka "toaster") with power limit set to 48W in BIOS - more than that the cooling cannot handle
- Cooler from the nVidia-GPU equipped version for an impressive extra 5W of cooling performance
- ExpressCard add on with 2 USB 3.0 ports (yay, 100MB/s!!)
- Monitor panel from an Alienware M14X laptop (one of the best you can get at 1400x900, which is not to say much, as they are rare and still crappy)
- Some German keyboard because I like the tactile experience more than the Portuguese ones (there were [3 different manufacturers of keyboard for this machine](http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/thinkpad-keyboard-identification.634208/))
- Custom hacked up vent with blue BGA chip heatsinks from china stuck to the cooler.
