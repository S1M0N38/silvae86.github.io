We were all there once:

- Interviewer: *So, is there anything else you want to know about the company?*
- You: *Hmm, no, I have no questions at this time, thank you!*
- Interviewer: *Alright, so I think we can wrap up for now. Thank you very much, and we will be in touch!*

And like that, you just lost one of the best opportunities to know more about the company where you will be spending 8 (at least) hours a day for the foreseeable future. 

# Common fears?

One can be nervous, feeling insecure, or just want the job so badly that we want to make a good impression at all costs! We feel that asking questions may: 

- leave the interviewer them with the impression that we want to know too much about the company's internal processes; 
- lead the conversation into a tough situation if the interviewer asks something about 

# There are no perfect companies!

# The first interview

The first interview of an IT recruitment process usually involves a psychological and English language assessment.

# The second/third/fourth/... technical interviews

Often these are carried out by senior engineers that take time out of their usually hectic work schedule to help out the company in finding new hires. This means that:

- They are generous and like to give back to the company, as interviewers usually alternate and sometimes volunteer to carry out these tasks within the team.
- They like to meet new people and see how they work, which technologies they are familiar with, and their life experience.

Also: 

- Interviewers can be thinking about the urgent tasks that absolutely positively must go into production in the next sprint, but still take the time to interview you. 
	- **Thank them for it**, and for listening to your frustrations when your code does not compile due to a line break when the online coding editor does not warn you about it like your own IDE does! ** __(Thats from personal experience btw)__.
- Your interviewer is an engineer like you! all they want is to allow a candidate's qualities to shine through. They also want to see if you are gonna be a tough person to work with or if you are nice and polite. 
- No one is there to grill you on purpose, and if they are, trust me... you do not want to work for that company in the first place!
- No engineer worth his/her salt likes to work with an a-hole! Interviews are an engineering team's first line of defense against those. 
	- Technical skills can be taught, frustration and resilience can be managed and trained... but politeness, respect, good manners and willingness to learn are the base of a nice working relationship. As an interviewer, I like to gauge these myself and then ask: "Would I like to work with this person?" If the answer is yes, I give positive feedback when asked !


# Questions

Here are some of the questions that I like to ask during a job interview. Some may seem trivial/naive at first, while others may seem like I am asking internal company details. 

If you are afraid to put off your interviewer, whenever you ask a question regarding tech stack / algorithms or processes, you can always start with "You don't have to answer this if you consider it to be internal company information"
