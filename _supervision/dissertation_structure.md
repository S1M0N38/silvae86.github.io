## A model dissertation report

1. Introduction
  1.1.  Context
  1.2.  Motivation (Why is the work needed? What is the perceived impact to the research/industry community to which it contributes?. This can be replaced with a section title that more closely matches the description of the problem).
  1.3.  Objectives (Objective tree, dividing a main, broad, high level objective into sub-objectives which can even become milestones at a later time. The objective tree helps to frame the work and can include objectives that other research or tech solutions have already achieved, the goals and subgoals to be achieved by this dissertation, and future goals that can be pursued as future work and which are outside of the scope of the dissertation). The objective tree should be clearly read and explained in the
2. State of the art or SOTA (This is an analysis and comparison of existing approaches, models technologies and tools related to the problem domain. It should provide an overview of the latest developments in research and industry, supporting the selection of a design approach and implementation approach, technological choices, experiment design, analysis and evaluation of results)...
  2.1. An introduction to the domain(s) of study related to the problem at hand (If the work draws experience from different research domains, from the base science, theoretical approaches to architecture design and implementation, it can be interesting to provide a first section in the SOTA that helps the reader understand why the following sections are there, tying them up via a chronological and logical flow. Highlighting the evolution of the related domains of study, explaining why a certain topic is relevant to the problem and thus why it is included in the SOTA.
  2.X.  The SOTA should have as many sections as needed (around 4 to 5 is a reasonable amount). The criteria is free, but each section should approach a domain or application related to the topic in question. For example, in a serious games and gamification dissertation, it could mean the theory behind serious games, the seminal works in the area, relevant concepts, academic experiments applying the concepts, and then moving on to industrial demonstrations of the application of such theories. Evaluation methods can and should also be included in the SOTA, to highlight how related works were evaluated, draw experience from them, which can later assist in the design of our own experiment, supporting our decisions in the choices made in past works (if it worked well for solid publications, then it might work in our case too).
  2.1.1.
  2.X.X---- 2.1.x .
